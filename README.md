# Transfer Learning Approaches for Cyberbullying Detection

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains my undergraduate thesis project focused on detecting cyberbullying using
state-of-the-art **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **transfer learning models**.
The goal of this research is to compare the performance of multiple deep learning and transformer-based
models for cyberbullying text classification.
